"""
Given a set of words (without duplicates), find all word squares you can build from them.

A sequence of words forms a valid word square if the kth row and column read the exact same string, where 0 â‰¤ k < max(numRows, numColumns).

For example, the word sequence ["ball","area","lead","lady"] forms a word square because each word reads the same both horizontally and vertically.

b a l l
a r e a
l e a d
l a d y


Input:
["area","lead","wall","lady","ball"]

Output:
[
  [ "wall",
    "area",
    "lead",
    "lady"
  ],
  [ "ball",
    "area",
    "lead",
    "lady"
  ]
]

Explanation:
The output consists of two word squares. The order of output does not matter (just the order of words in each word square matters).

length of word determines the number of words in the group.
words must be same length, all words are guaranteed same length
order of words matter because we need to check for forms

use 1 word as anchor, then find the next word that match the prefix
when prefix is the entire word and we can find such word, we found a word square

"b all" requires "a", 1 word stat with a which is area"
"ba ll" requires "l", 1 word start with le which is lead or lady
"bal l" requires "l", 1 word start with lad which is ....

we need to check prefix a lot, we can use trie to match the word
backtracking to match the words, add to result when we find one
