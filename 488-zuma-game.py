"""
Think about Zuma Game. You have a row of balls on the table, colored red(R), yellow(Y), blue(B), green(G), and white(W).
You also have several balls in your hand.

Each time, you may choose a ball in your hand,
and insert it into the row (including the leftmost place and rightmost place).
Then, if there is a group of 3 or more balls in the same color touching, remove these balls.
Keep doing this until no more balls can be removed.

Find the minimal balls you have to insert to remove all the balls on the table. If you cannot remove all the balls, output -1.

You may assume that the initial row of balls on the table wonâ€™t have any 3 or more consecutive balls with the same color.
1 <= board.length <= 16
1 <= hand.length <= 5
Both input strings will be non-empty and only contain characters 'R','Y','B','G','W'.


Input: board = "WRRBBW", hand = "RB"
Output: -1
Explanation: WRRBBW -> WRR[R]BBW -> WBBW -> WBB[B]W -> WW

Input: board = "WWRRBBWW", hand = "WRBRW"
Output: 2
Explanation: WWRRBBWW -> WWRR[R]BBWW -> WWBBWW -> WWBB[B]WW -> WWWW -> empty

Input: board = "G", hand = "GGGGG"
Output: 2
Explanation: G -> G[G] -> GG[G] -> empty

Input: board = "RBYYBBRRB", hand = "YRBGB"
Output: 3
Explanation: RBYYBBRRB -> RBYY[Y]BBRRB -> RBBBRRB -> RRRB -> B -> B[B] -> BB[B] -> empty

16*15*14*13*12*5*4*3*2

greedily only put ball next to same color, default to putting ball on the right to simplify
once we put a ball, we can run a check to remove like colors (could be recursively)

to find minimal balls, better to run BFS, number of times switching layer is number of balls

to get to a state, we need a unique number of balls, but we need to track balls used to get to the next level
-> explored set is state of the map
